# 📜 **CODE OF CONDUCT**

## **1. Purpose**

The goal of this project is to maintain a collaborative, respectful, and inclusive environment for anyone contributing to the Corporate RFM Analytics Suite.

We work with complex technologies—machine learning, causal inference, customer analytics, embeddings, and real-time systems—and rely on constructive, thoughtful communication.
This Code of Conduct outlines the expectations for participant behaviour and the consequences of unacceptable behaviour.

We are committed to providing a harassment-free, safe, and professional experience for everyone.
